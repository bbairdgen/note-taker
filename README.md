  ## Description
  
  This is a note taker application that allows you to save and store notes. I created this to practice Express.js and creating routes. Much of the code was given to me but I had to make the routes on my own. I did learn a lot about how the different js files connect and how to get the notes to correctly activate. I also learned how the smallest typo can ruin the best laid plans of men.

  ## Usage
  
  Once you enter the application, Enter a title for the note and then any note content. You must click on the save button in the top right-hand corner of the screen. Once it is saved the note will be viewable on the left-hand side of the screen. Click on the note title to expand and view the note details. If you are looking at a note and would like to add another note, click on the "+" icon located in the top right-hand side of the screen. When you no longer wish to keep a note, click on the trash can icon on the note.
